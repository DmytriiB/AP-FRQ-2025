## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- My intial aproach was to use Math.min to compare in the if and else statements.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I decided to just use operators like > instead of Math.min cause its just simplifyes the code.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- If and else statements
- Boolean expressions
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned that there is many ways of actually solving this problem
