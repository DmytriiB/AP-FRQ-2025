# AP-FRQ-2025

*Solutions written by Dmytrii Bashta*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 05/07/25. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Expirience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation for the exam included:
  - Doing the Princeton Review book
  - Asking Copilot to give me a Review sheet about all the units
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were:
  - Time management
  - Multiple Choice
- Time management techniques that worked well for me was kinda scanning through text and mostly focusing on the code
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions was just rereading the question and trying to figure out what the question was asking me

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- 2D array: [i need to improve on how to transverse array in different ways like from up to down or from left to right] 
- Array List: [i need to imrove on memorizing all the key features of Array List like suing .size() instead of .length or using .get() .
- Programming practice: [practicing transversing 2D arrays]

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- [Coding Bat , https://codingbat.com/java]
- [Copilot , https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/WnTQ51bG8swMNj9zYTTS5]
- [AP classroom , https://shorturl.at/Or2JM]

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:

- [Make my own small videogame]
- [The exam inspired me about an idea that anything can be coded]
- [Use more AI in learning process]
