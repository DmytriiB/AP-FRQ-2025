## Question 3 Analysis
### Round and buildMatches

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Array and Array List):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- For part A i initialized ArrayList and added all the competitors into that list using for loop. For part B i used 1 for loop and if and else stament to see that there is any more matches that can be made.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I had a same response for part A but in part B i used nested loops instead of 1 loop.

#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Array List
- if and else statements
- for loop and nested loop
 
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned that nested loops might be way easier for this type of problems
