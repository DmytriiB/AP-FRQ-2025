## Question 4 Analysis
### SumOrSameGame

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Array):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- For part A i declared and initialized 2D array and by using nested for loops i placed random integer number from 1 to 9 into the array. I didnt have time for part B during the exam.

#### My revised solution after review:
- I had something similar for part A but in part B i used nested for loops to go through every single integer to find the same integer as the one that was given as a parameter or any of those that both of them would add up to 10 and i did it by using 2 if statements and if it finds a pair it would return true but if not then return false.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- For loop
- 2D array
- transversing the 2D array
- comparing values in 2D array
 
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned better on how to transverse the 2D array and how to compare the values in it.
