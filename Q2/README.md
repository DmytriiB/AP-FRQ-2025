## Question 2 Analysis
### SignedText

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- First i declared and initialized variable and creatd the constructor for the class. Then in first method we just creating the signature with first and last name. In the second method i just used if, else if and else statements for all three cases of signature place and i used indexOf to find the place of signature.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I mostly had the same code except in the second method i created 2 more variables for signature and its length so that if statements wouldnt be that long
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Class structure
- Methods
- if and else
 
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned that adding extra variables in the code can safe you some time because you would not have really long if statements
